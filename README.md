## Unit Projects Overview
DSI requires students to complete **four** unit projects. Students will be provided the Jupyter notebook starter-code for each project. 

---

Projects  | Deadline | Description | Requirements | Solutions
--------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | --------- |
[Unit Project 1][1-1A] |4th Sept 2017, Monday, 6am|Python + Pokemon Data|Students will demonstrate command of basic Python data structures, implement Python syntax for control log functions, and calculate descriptive statistics.|  [Project 1 Solutions][1-2A]  |
[Unit Project 2][1-1B] |15th Sept 2017, Friday, 6am|EDA + Double Datasets|Students will analyze SAT and drug use datasets & explicitly state their assumptions. They will form hypotheses and justify them with solid statistical testing in NumPy, while visualizing and interpreting their plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.|  [Project 2 Solutions][1-2B]  |
[Kaggle (Group Project)][1-1C] |29th Sept 2017, Friday|Classification + Mosquito Data|Groups will create a repo to host a notebook of their work, then submit clearly documented code to the Kaggle Leaderboard, which uses roughly 30% of the dataset to score an AUC (Area Under Curve) metric. Groups will clearly document their observations and create a short presentation on their findings to share with the class.| N/A  |
[Unit Project 3][1-1D] |6th Oct 2017, Friday, 6am|Regression + Housing Data|Students will review the Ames housing dataset & explicitly state their assumptions. Then they will clean, impute, and explore the dataset, justifying their modeling choices and any feature engineering. They will need to plot, visualize, and interpret their data while clearly outlining their modeling strategy in response to the prompted questions. They will also need to explain their results to a technical audience.|  [Project 3 Solutions][1-2D]  |
[Unit Project 4][1-1E] |27th Oct 2017, Friday, 6am|Web Scraping + Career Data|Students will scrape and prepare their own data, then create and compare at least two models for each section: an ensemble model or decision tree, and a classifier or regression model. They will document their data and models in a notebook for technical peers, while also creating a written summary for non-technical stakeholders.|  N/A  |

## Capstone Project
Projects  | Deadline | Description | Requirements | Solutions
--------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | --------- |
[Capstone Projects][1-1F] |<ul><li>Part 1 - Pitch: 22nd Sept 2017 </li><li>Part 2 - Dataset: 13th October, Friday </li><li>Part 3 - EDA: 20th Oct 2017</li><li>Part 4 - Findings:10th Nov 2017</li><li>Part 5 - Presentation:17th Nov 2017</li>|Student's Choice of Model + Data|The capstone project is a culmination of the student's work and serves as their Portfolio project. They will have the last 4 weeks of the course to work on their capstone project.|  N/A |
